# Jamstack ECommerce Website for Intelligent Lifting

## Objective

The goal of this project is to bring afforable workout plans to everyone. The goal is to use **AWS Amplify** to host the website, **DynamoDB** to store the workout plans, **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway** to handle the backend, and **Stripe** to handle payments.

We will use Nextjs / React / Tailwind CSS for the frontend. Do all the serverless tasks using AWS.
