### Working out changed my life, I will now help you do the same.

## The Vision
Our vision is to use the transformative power of exercise to improve the lives of as many people as possible. We believe that everyone should have access to high-quality workout plans that are backed by science and tailored to their needs and goals. That's why we are committed to offering free workout plans and expend into a range of other products and services designed to support and enhance people's fitness journeys. We believe that our focus is helping others, rather than maximizing profit. This will enable us to make a meaningful difference in the world and inspire others to do the same.

## Method - How will we bring our vision to life?
As we work to bring our vision to life, we will take advantage of the many free services offered by **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** to help us build and operate our website. We will use **serverless technology**, such as **AWS Lambda**, to ensure that our systems are scalable and reliable, and we will use the latest front-end technologies, like **React and Next**, to create a fast and optimized website that provides a seamless user experience. To help cover our costs as we scale, we may also roll out some products that are not free. However, our main focus will always be on helping as many people as possible, and we will strive to keep our prices as low as possible while still providing high-quality products and services.
